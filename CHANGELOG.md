# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-10

First stable release.

### Added
- **Spatial alignment toolbar** — multi-element alignment and distribution controls (align left/center/right/top/middle/bottom, distribute horizontally/vertically)
- **Keyboard shortcuts help dialog** — `?` opens an overlay listing all shortcuts
- **SEO & social sharing** — OG tags and Twitter `summary_large_image` card for link previews

### Improved
- **Mobile toolbox FAB** — cleaner icon, more consistent with desktop toolbar style
- **Tool cursors** — eraser and text tools now use purpose-built cursors instead of fallback defaults

### Fixed
- Canvas hint position adjusted to sit above the bottom toolbar islands on mobile
- Hide fill/background color pickers for line and arrow in the mobile style panel

---

## [0.0.8] — 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Keyboard shortcuts help dialog** — accessible via `?` key

### Improved
- Mobile toolbox FAB icon redesigned for clarity

### Fixed
- Fill and background color controls no longer appear for line/arrow elements in the mobile style panel

---

## [0.0.7] — 2026-04-08

### Improved
- **Text tool — fluid editing (Excalidraw-style)** — clicking to create or edit text no longer shows a dashed outline while typing; `Enter` inserts a newline instead of committing; clicking outside (blur) confirms the text. The element auto-resizes both width and height to fit the actual content after every edit.

---

## [0.0.6] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Mermaid paste hang on cyclic diagrams** — pasting a flowchart with back edges (e.g. `D --> B` where B is an ancestor of D) caused the layout BFS to loop infinitely, freezing the browser tab. A depth cap (`nodeIds.length`) now guarantees termination; DAG layouts are unaffected.

### Dev
- Added `vitest.config.ts` to decouple the test runner from the Cloudflare Vite plugin, restoring `pnpm test` after the Vite 8 dependency update.

---

## [0.0.3] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Mermaid import** — import `.mmd` / `.mermaid` files via drag-and-drop or the new toolbar button; paste Mermaid text directly from the clipboard (`Ctrl+V`)
- Supported diagram types: `graph` / `flowchart` (directions TD, LR, RL, BT) and `sequenceDiagram`
- Node shapes auto-mapped: `[]` → rectangle, `(())` → ellipse, `{}` → rhombus
- Edge types: solid arrows `-->`, dashed arrows `-.->`, plain lines `---`; inline labels preserved
- Viewport auto-fits to the imported diagram after conversion

---
